# README for Moon Classifier SVM Chatbot

## Overview
This repository contains a Python implementation of a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier trained on synthetic moon-shaped data. The project demonstrates the process of data generation, model training, evaluation, and visualization using scikit-learn and matplotlib.

## Features
- Synthetic moon-shaped dataset generation using `sklearn.datasets.make_moons`
- Data splitting into training and test sets
- SVM model training with RBF kernel
- Model evaluation using accuracy score
- Visualization of classification results

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- NumPy
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib

## Installation
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/moon-classifier-svm.git
   cd moon-classifier-svm
   ```

2. Install the required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install numpy scikit-learn matplotlib
   ```

## Usage
Run the Jupyter notebook `MoonClassifierSVM.ipynb` to:
1. Generate synthetic moon-shaped data
2. Split the data into training and test sets
3. Train an SVM classifier
4. Evaluate the model's performance
5. Visualize the classification results

## Results
The SVM model achieves approximately 97% accuracy on the test set. The visualization shows:
- Training data points
- Test data predictions
- Clear separation between the two classes
